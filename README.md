Story publishing exclusive for startups

Parrot is a story publishing platform for startups to publish their own story just like how tech-crunch or other technology blog does. There has been a sea change in the way content today is being created, distributed and consumed.

We want to create a platform whereby every john doe will be able to create and publish his own startup story, while empowering the community to decide which content is relevant.

why we want to embrace the democratization open up the means where startups can be their own story editor and publisher.

Access and means to create and publish content is limited to staff editors or freelancers.e.g tech-crunch editors e.t.c and audiences had very little say, while all content decisions were made by publishers
